# IT_hub_core
This is the core of the Bhadale IT Hub that offers the minimum base image required to integrate various platform and technologies and is driven by a good middleware allowing for  rapid onboarding. The hub core is another module of the overall hub architecture along with multi cloud platform interfaces, API interfaces, aggregation layers, quantum layers, AI/ML layers etc. Typically the core represents the server part of the overall system, however the client part is the Solution Cafe that will also has a smaller footprint of this core. Domain specific layers, Quantum layer, AI,ML layers and many more identified layers will have various elements and these are then aggregated in these layers based on user requests. Admins will create and configure the layers and have pointers to various hub assets that host third party entitites like cloud assets. 

Clients typically have client side apps, terminal windows,or quatum layer based secure communication along with the classical 7 layer OSI stack. Quantum protocols for superposition, entanglement, teleportation, blind computing, dense coding, density matrix , quantum channels etc all will allow for the adaption of the QAI features and use of photonics-atom interaction principles for encoding, communication and decoding.      


Few of the questions that are addressed to ensure quality are:  

1) How will QAI hub facilitate the fusion of the available STDs, frameworks and any required Code, FPGA, elements in an integrated Systems, Software, HW,NW, Sec design and operations. Will this be a new architecture for QAI hub. How unique this is from other middlewares, control systems, Hybrid systems. Will it be an universal framework for the universal QC for FPGA QC.

2) What language will it use , python, assembly, and AI intelligent mapping, transformer to route data in a auto pilot model. 

3) Why is a need for another hub, when existing hybrid multi cloud, multi platforms offer good support. Will it be focused on QAI technologies like quantum internet, Intelligent nw, self diagnosis, self heal, 6G etc. 

4) How QAI hub offer services, API, REST, Soa, Security, network and interfaces to popular cloud platforms.

5) Hub-as-a-Service, 'Solution cafe' as a hub client service. How browser based calls are developed?

6) What form factors your hub assets offer. How they offer them in the Data center racks, Enterprise standalone servers, Home servers, etc

7) What client app used to interact with hub backends. Hub client is solution cafe module and hosts various client calls for operations, control and commands from hub core platform.

8) What is the minimum code used so that it adds more value than overheads.

9) How various industries can order your hub components like hub servers, hub client etc.

10) Will this be an overlay using cloud platforms or something new setup in a VPN sandbox with isolation and tenant scalability using existing cloud features

11) How are your products and system design used for various quantum products and how they work in a cloud and your hub model using server box and a client browser.

12) Draw a diagram how you integrate your products and hub software.

13) If I would give you order to build a NISQ QC, what are the components used, howyour hub, client app used are fused with these components.

14) How will your hub help in simulation, linking to various backends, systems etc, how the configuration done?
